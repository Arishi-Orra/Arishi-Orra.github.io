    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I am a Ph.D. scholar under the [School of Mathematical & Statistical Sciences](https://smss.iitmandi.ac.in/index.php) at the [IIT Mandi](https://www.iitmandi.ac.in/) under the supervision of Prof. [Manoj Thakur](https://som.iitmandi.ac.in/people/faculty/manoj-thakur), specializing in Deep Reinforcement Learning with applications in financial decision-making. My research focuses on developing intelligent trading agents and portfolio optimization models that adapt to dynamic market conditions using advanced machine learning techniques. I am passionate about algorithmic trading, financial modeling, and building real-world AI systems that bridge the gap between theory and practice.
